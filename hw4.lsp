; CS 161 Spring 2013: HW4 skeleton

; FUNCTION: ANSWER
; PURPOSE:  Search through the passed-in episodic memory (list of frame atoms)
;           for a frame that can be UNIFRAME'd (homework #3) with the query
;           frame, by binding variables expressed in the query.
; OUTPUT:   If a frame that can be unified is found, substitute the corresponding
;           binding into the question frame, and return the result.
;           As a special case, if the predicate of the query is "ACT" (which corresponds
;           roughly to an English query "what did... do..."), then ANSWER should look
;           for frames in the episodic memory whose slots unify with the slots of
;           the query, with the exception of the "IS" slot in the query, which
;           can be ignored. It should return the result of unifying the found
;           frame with the query (leaving out the "IS" slot). For example, see
;           the Test-Case-2 in the homework PDF.
;           If no frame can be found, then return NIL.
; INPUTS:   QCON: query frame
;           EP-STMEM: list of frame atoms to search for answer in

; FUNCTION: C-GEN
; PURPOSE:  Converts a frame into an English sentence, using a list of "sentence
;           patterns" (ENG-PATS) and decision-trees to help make some more
;           natural sounding phrasings.
; OUTPUT:   List of atoms, readible as an English sentence. (Essentially, this
;           is the inverse of the "C-ANALYZE" operation from HW#2)
; INPUTS:   C-ANS: a frame to convert into a sentence
;           ENG-PATS: a list of English sentence patterns, of the form
;           ( (pred (element)* ) )
;           where element is either
;           -- An atom (interpreted as a slot name), in which case C-GEN should
;              insert the result of recursing on the FILLER of that slot
;           -- A list of the form (PHR (atom)+) (the literal symbol PHR followed by a list of
;              atoms, interpreted as words to append to the sentence)
;           -- A list of the form (DECIDE PRED), in which case the utility function 
;              DECIDE-PHR will be dispatched to use the entry for PRED in D-TREES to 
;              decide which words to add (see specs for DECIDE-PHR)
;           D-TREES: a list of decision trees, whose format is described in
;                    the documentation for DECIDE-PHR

; FUNCTION: DECIDE-PHR
; PURPOSE:  Locate in the list of D-TREES an entry indexed by the given predicate
;           DECIDE-PHR then traverses the decision tree, checking attributes
;           of the TOP-LEVEL SLOTS of the frame in the order of traversal. Leaf
;           nodes always are a list of the form (PHR (word)+), that is a list
;           starting with the literal element "PHR" and followed by a list of
;           atoms listing a phrase.
; OUTPUT:   A phrase (list of words), or NIL if not found
; INPUTS:   PRED: predicate to choose which tree out of our list of d-trees
;           FRAME: frame to check top-level slots of
;           D-TREES: list of decision trees, indexed by predicate; format is
;           ( (pred-1 (node (val-1-1 (leaf or node�))
;                � � 
;                       (val-1-n (leaf or node�)))
;             (pred-2 (node (val-2-1 (leaf or node...)) � )
;           For example, the D-TREES list:
;           ( (HUMAN
;               (NOBILITY
;                  (ROYAL (GENDER
;                            (FEMALE (PHR (QUEEN)))
;                            (MALE (PHR (KING)))
;                         )
;                  )
;                  (NOBLE (GENDER
;                            (MALE (PHR (LORD)))
;                            (FEMALE (PHR (LADY)))
;                         )
;                  )
;                  (COMMON (PHR (PEASANT)))
;               )
;             )
;           )
;           has a single tree, which is defined for frames whose predicate is HUMAN.
;           It first checks the TOP-LEVEL slot "NOBILITY" -- if it is "royal," then it
;           checks the TOP-LEVEL slot "GENDER" and outputs either (QUEEN) or (KING)
;           accordingly. (Similarly for "NOBLE"; but if NOBILITY is "COMMON" then
;           it doesn't check gender, it just outputs (PEASANT)).
